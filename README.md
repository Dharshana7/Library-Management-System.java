📚 Library Management System (Java)

📌 Project Overview
The Library Management System is a console-based Java application developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
It allows users to manage books and members, perform borrowing and returning operations, and search for books efficiently.
This project demonstrates encapsulation, class interaction, validation, and menu-driven programming in Java.

🎯 Features
Add and manage books
Register library members
Borrow and return books
Search books by title or author
Check book availability
Menu-driven user interface
Proper validation for borrowing and returning

🛠️ Technologies Used
Java
OOP Concepts (Encapsulation, Abstraction)
Collections (ArrayList)
Scanner for user input
